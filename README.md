## The OO CodeClan Caraoke (CCC)

You have been approached to build software for a Karaoke bar. Specifically, they want you to build a software for checking guests in and out, plus handling songs.

Your program should be test driven and should be able to:

#### - Done
- Create rooms, songs and guests
#### - Done
- Check in guests to rooms/Check out guests from rooms
#### - Done
- Add songs to rooms

### Extensions

#### - Done
- What happens if there are more guests trying to be checked in than there is free space in the room? 
#### - Done
- Karaoke venues usually have an entry fee - So the guests could have money so they can pay it. 


### Advanced extensions

#### - Done
- Guests could have a favourite song, and if their favourite song is on the room's playlist, they can cheer loudly! (return a string like "Whoo!") ### - Done
#### - Pending
- Rooms can keep track of the entry fees/spending of the guests - maybe add a bar tab/bar class?
- Add anything extra you think would be good to have at a karaoke venue!
